USABILITY

1. What is usability?
 1.1 Methods have changed accomodating new technology
 1.2 How can we evaluate usability faster and still get a good result?

2. Usability describes a quality in an interaction design.
 2.1 A system needs to be reliable, stable, interactive and have good usability.
 2.2 Three Definitions:
	* Effectiveness: the accuracy and completeness with which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments.
	* Efficiency: the resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness of goals achieved.
	* Satisfaction: the comfrt and acceptability of the work system to its users and other people affected by its use.

3. Its different from user experience.
 3.1 You have usability goals in the middle of a spectrum. This is the things we usually talk about concerning usability.
 	Easy to remember, easy to learn, efficient to use, effective to use, safe to use, have good utility.
 3.2 And an outer circle that CAN be useful when describing usability for a software system.
 	Entertaining, helpfu, motivating, aesthetically pleasing, supportive of creativity, rewarding, emotionally fulfilling etc.

4. Is essential in everyday things and expert things. So both not-so-everyday and everyday items are all interactive.
 4.1 Think of the context of what system we're desigining. Has implications.
 4.2 Can't always apply the same design choices for different software for very different purposes. Not always the same design process.
 4.3 Complexity has an influence on design choices.

5. Usability evaluation.
 5.1 What is the purpose?
 	* Identify
 		What are the problems?
 		Never the end product, just the first step to refine it.
 	* Starting point for refinements of design.
 5.2 Outcome
 	* Ranked list of problems, sorted in some way. Fx. What is most important
 	* What works well and what sucks?
 5.3 Different approaches.
 	* Expert evaluators or evaluating with the users.
 	* Lab or field study?

6. Types of evaluation.
 6.1 Exploratory analysis.
 	* User and usage, Specification of requirements, preliminary design
 6.2 Assessment test.
 	* Detailed design
 6.3 Validation test.
 	* Product build, do the other things first before getting here!
 	* Validate your design.
 6.4 All of the above are comparable tests.
 6.5 Release product.

7. How to evaluate - Heuristic
 7.1 Heuristic inspection
 	* Experts form a checklist and inspects design based on it
 	* Scenarios/personas + relevant tasks can structure process
 	* Produces a ranked list of usability problems
 7.2 Pros
 	* Can save time on usability testing, no need for user interaction
 	* if you get 3-5 people to inspect using this method you get around 70% of problems
 7.3 Cons
 	* Needs to have a dev team that can properly do these inspections, based on actual skill
 	* Can hit "false" usablity problems
 	* Can cause cosmetic problems

8. How to evaluate - User-based evaluation
 8.1 Involve users.
 	* User interacts with system and you observe.
 	* Task solving and "thinkin-aloud"
 	* Test monitor observes and take notes
 	* Make a ranked list of problems
 8.2 Pros
 	* Gets a very precise idea of users problems
 8.3 Cons
 	* Test situation can feel unnatural
 	* We want them to converse with us not us with them
 	* Time consuming and difficult

9. User evaluation in detail
 9.1 A Problem is experienced
 	* The user is delayed or prevented in completing a task
 	* The user feels frustrated
 	* The user makes a mistake
 	* The user misses important info

10. Expert-based evaluations
 10.1 A potential problem identified by expert.

LOOK IMAGE TITLED: "Description-of-Evaluation"

11. Procedure
 - Create scenarios and tasks
 - Test scenarios and tasks (pilot test)
 - Define and divide rles (test monitor, observe etc.)
 - Plan data collection (what and how to collect)
 - Recruit test users
 - Carry out the evaluation
 - finalize the log files (transcripts)
 - Analyze data
 - Give feedback to designers/devs

12. Procedure "On the day"
 12.1 Introduction
 	* Instructions about the test
 	* Consent form
 	* Questionnaire (demographics)
 12.2 Test subject solves tasks using the design
 	* Test subject "thinks aloud"
 	* Test monitor facilitates
 	* Test is recorded on video
 	* Observer takes notes and creates log file
 		- A description of what the user is doing
 12.3 Post-evaluation debriefing/interview

13. Evaluating in the lab
 13.1 Pros
 	* User based is usually done in the "lab"
 	* A "lab" is not an actual lab
 	* Structured, can easily set up hidden camera in HD as opposed to the field evaluation in THEIR office
 	* Can easily be replicated and controlled
 13.2 Cons
 	* Feels artificial
 	* Can cause varying answers if the user is not comfortable
 13.3 Cons outweigh Pros early in project

14. Test Subjects
 14.1 Representative
 	* Demographics
 	* Experience in the problem domain
 14.2 Number of subjects
 	* Generalizability, not everyone is a solid representation of the entire user group
 	* Quantitive conclusions, kvantitiv
 	* Statistics, MORE the better in finding usability problems
 14.3 Fellow students
 	* Problematic
 	* Motivation lacking
 	* Demographic and experience (not much maybe or maybe a lot)

15. Conducting a lab evaluation
 15.1 Give and introduction on what you are going to ask them and how the whole experiment will proceed.
 15.2 Tasks
 15.3 Good tasks
 	* Represent a real use of the system
 	* Describe the end result
 	* Motivation is key
 	* Don't make the user spend too much time
 	* Include relevant data like names and profession
 	* Group tasks together, if you provide to much help the task becomes meaningless
 15.4 Typical problems
 	* Vague details
 	* Provide too much lep
 	* Dont use technical terms, use regular pleb language
 	* Dont force them into a structured interview sort of guideline.

16. VIDEO - My observation on what usability problems occur
- Confused about navigation slightly
- Could not find a specific thing she needed to be able to write something
	. She found it after a short while
- Subject accidentally closed something and got a warning message and go confused as a result.
- Nu er siden gr√• thats how i can see it.
- Wasn't easy to learn and remember
- Efficiency problem a lot of things not grouped together in a coherent interface

17. VIDEO 2
 17.1 Critical, serious, cosmetic problems
 17.2 In case of different experience of severity you will typically choose the most severe
 	* A critical problem means unable to continue, feels the system is against them, critical difference between believed and actual state of the system
 17.3 Catastrophes
 	* System is behaving so differently and inherently causing more problems than solving them
 	* More than one user encountered same problem
- How do I do dis?!?!?!??!
- Shortened word4
- The program doesnt remind her of any other program shes used probably
- She got completely lost and that can elude to a critical problem
