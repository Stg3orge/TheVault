1. What is the MOST Important open problem in Computing?
- Increasing Programmer Productivity
	. Write Programs quickly
	. Write programs easily
	. Write programs correctly
We need to make programmers more efficient.

- 3 ways to incease productivity
	. ( Process in software engineering )
	. ( Tools, static analysis, program generation )
	. ( Better designed Languages )

- Every language has some flaw that can be remedied in a new language

2. What is a programming language

- A set of rules to convey your intentions to a computer
- Some languages are good at some specific thing others are better at other things

3. Criteria on good language

Readability
	How easy is it to comprehend
Write-ability
	Easy to write the code
Reliability
	How easy is it to write programs that dont go wrong
Orthogonality
	The ease of using structures like an array in many differet ways, JAVA has example of parsing an array to a method

(Evaluate your language on some of these criteria)

Programming languages has to be specific so theres no confusion

4. Programming Language Specification

3 specification:

Semantics
	
Contextual constraints
Syntax
