<p class="para1"> No offense but all of you who identify with this need to see a therapist or really start taking your mental health seriously. I really think a lot of you aren't completely joking, some of you aren't joking at all. If left unaddressed, you will end up completely alone and it will get harder and harder for you to have a social life again. It will eventually reach the point where you are completely incapable of having non-awkward and painful social interaction. Being lonely is a primary cause of mental illness and the longer you are alone, the worse you get. It eventually becomes a vicious cycle of rejection, loneliness and increasing mental illness. I don't care if you think not having a social life is a big deal, but most jobs require social skills and extreme social difficulties will make holding down a job very difficult. You're really screwing yourself if you just think this stuff is a joke because other people with the same problem make memes about it that you laugh at. I mean me too thanks
