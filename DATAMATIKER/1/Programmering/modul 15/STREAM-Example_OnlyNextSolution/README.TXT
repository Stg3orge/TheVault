This project contains compiled Java .class files which are shown
as a class without sources. Please DO NOT modify or delete the files in the
project folder, as this will break the application.

Notice how IDate does not have a dependency arrow to Date.
IDate does use the Date class, but it cannot be detected by BlueJ, as
it cannot analyze the source code to determine this dependency.

Wait a minute! Why did you not provide the source code for the GUI?!
Well, we have not learned about Swing yet, and I don't want you to get lost
in code that has no learning value at the moment!
